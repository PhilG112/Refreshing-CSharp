The role of Events:
- Events are notifications, they go out to one or more listeners/subscribers listening for changes in events.
- They play a central role in the .NET framework.
- Provide a way to trigger notifications from end users or from objects.
- Events signal the occurrence of an action/notifications.
- Objects that raise events don't need to explicitly know the object that will handle the event.
- Events pass EventArgs (event data).

The role of Delegates:
- Pipeline between an event and eventhandler.
- Specialized class often called a "function pointer".
- Based on a MulticastDelegate base class

The role of Event Handlers:
- Responsible for receiving and processing data from a delegate.
- Two Parameters:
	- Sender
	- EventArgs:
		- EventArgs responsible for encapsulating event data
- public void btnSubmit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Handling of button click occurs here }

Mutlicast Delegates:
- Can reference more than one delegate function.
- Tracks delegate references using an incovation list.
- Delegates in the list are invoked sequentially.
