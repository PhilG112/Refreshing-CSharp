What are interfaces?
Interfaces describe a group of related functions that can belong to any class or struct. They are contracts. They can only define properties, methods, events or indexers. The members are always public.
They are the 'what' not the 'how'.


Abstract classes:
	May contain implementation code.
	A class may inherit from a  single base class.
	Members have access modifiers.
	Can contain all normal things a class has.

Interfaces:
	May not contain implementation code.
	A class may implement any number of interfaces.
	Members are automatically public.
	Limited to what can be defined. See above.
